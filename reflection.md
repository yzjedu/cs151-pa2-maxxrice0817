What challenges did you encounter?
How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
Did you overcome them, and how?
Any key takeaways?
Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
What was it like working by yourself?

- I encountered multiple challenges throughout this PA, the first one was error checking. Initially I put if statements instead of while statement when 
- error checking to make sure the sticks taken when either 3, 2, or 1 so if you just entered a number outside of that range a second time it would work.
- Learning how to change players was difficult as well, it took lots of trouble-shooting but eventually I understood it.
- A key takeaway I have from this is the importance of error checking as when I did not error check and had my friends play my game they could cheat
- and win everytime they played, thereby ruining the whole experience. Another big takeaway I got was the importance of using comments to organize your
- code. While writing this program because it was longer and more complicated than my previous ones I often got lost and by writing comments earlier I
- could have avoided this.
- I believe I learned what I was supposed to from this lab as I practiced error checking, used loops and grew more comfortable with them, and used decision
- making in my code as well. Working by myself ids always more challenging than working with peers as collaboration always has made my program better
- and the whole process easier as you can use both of your knowledge to try and solve errors which may occur.
